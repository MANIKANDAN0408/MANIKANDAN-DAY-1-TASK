# Write a Blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

* HTTP1.1 :

A. It usually works on the textual format
B. It usually request resources inlining for use getting multiple 
C. There is head of line blocking that blocks all the request behind it untill it doesn't get its all resources
D. It compresses data by itself
E. The first usable version of HTTP was created in 1997 and it went through several stages of development
F. HTTP 1.1 delivers faster delivery of web pages and it reduces web traffic
G. Developed by Timothy Berners-Lee in 1989 as a communication standard for the World Wide Web


*HTTP 2 :

A. It works on binary framing layer insted of textual 
B. It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages
C. It allows multiplexing, so one TCP connection is required for multiple request
D. It uses HPACK for data compression 
E. HTTP2 was developed over the SPDY protocol  
F. HTTP2 improves both site performance and server efficiency



# Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in javascript 

A. Objects in javascript is the mopst important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern javascript
B. Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of the primitive data types
C. Objects in Javascript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data of reference type in form of "key:value" pairs 
D. A Javascript object is a collection of nemed values having state and behaviour. eg.person, car, per
E. A simple diagram is probably the best way to give a quick overview of the object representation in Javascript
F. Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
   An object can be created with figure brackets {…} with an optional list of properties. A property is a “key: value” pair, where a key is a string (also called a “property name”), and value can be anything.

   To understand this rather abstract definition, let us look at an example of a JavaScript Object :

   let school = {
   name : “Vivekananda School”,
   location : “Delhi”,
   established : “1971”
   }
   In the above example “name”, “location”, “established” are all “keys” and “Vivekananda School”, “Delhi” and 1971 are values of these keys respectively.
